This repo is meant so that I can share my VIM settings with my team and between my development machines. Also serves as a great backup.

#VIM
All VIM settings are stored in the myVim folder.
These are just a starting point, feel free to edit them as you wish.

Just copy all the contents of the myVim folder to your home dir and enjoy.

Requirements:

Ack plugin:

NOTE: You must, of course, install the ack script
in your path.
On Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install ack-grep
ln -s /usr/bin/ack-grep /usr/bin/ack
With MacPorts:
sudo port install p5-app-acki

#Other files
bash_profile and git settings are here as well to make things easier when setting up a new development machine.
